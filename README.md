# book-search
This project takes existing code for a working Google Books API search engine using a RESTful API and upgrades it to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The technology stack used includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (MERN). The app lets users search for books, save searches, and more.
### How It Works:

The MERN stack consists of four technologies:
1 MongoDB (Database)
2 Express.js (Server)
3 ReactJS (Frontend)
4 Node.js (Runtime)
### How to Use It:

Search for Books:
   - Load the app to find the "Search for Books" and "Login/Signup" options, an input field, and a submit button.
   - After entering a search term, you'll see search results with book details.

Login/Signup:
   - The "Login/Signup" option opens a modal with login or signup toggles.
   - On the signup toggle, enter a username, email, password, and sign up.
   - On the login toggle, enter your email and password to log in.

Saved Books:
   - Once logged in, options change to "Search for Books," view saved books, and "Logout."
   - Save books to your account and remove them.

Logout:
   - Clicking "Logout" logs you out and returns you to the initial menu.
